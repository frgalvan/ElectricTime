# ElectricTime
## Motivation
This was a project for my UX design course at UCB.  This is was my introduction into mobile development and coding in Java.  The learning objectives were to:
- set up the Android SDK/ Environment
- learn to program a basic android application
- test the application in the Android emulator

## Brief Overview
We were given creative freedom to design this application.  As a result, we had to build the project from scratch.
|Vehicle | Speed | Range |
|:-----:|------| ------ |
|  walking  | 3.1 mph | 30 miles |
|  Boosted Mini S Board  | 18 mph| 7 miles |
|  Evolve Bamboo GTR 2-in-1 | 24 mph | 31 miles |
| OneWheel XR | 19 mph | 18 miles |
| MotoTec Skateboard | 22 mph | 10 miles |
| Segway Ninebot S | 10 mph | 13 miles |
| Segway Ninebot S-PLUS | 12 mph | 22 miles |
| Razor Scooter | 18 mph | 15 miles | 
| GeoBlade 500 | 15 mph | 8 miles |
| Hovertrax Hoverboard | 9 mph | 6 miles|

Given 9 different electric-powered vehicles with varying speeds and ranges,  our application was to allow users to select the type of electric transport and their desired distance to travel. The application should then return how much time it would take to complete their journey.  The user should also see the equivalent amount of time required to travel that distance for the remainder of the list 
*(i.e. convert the user's input across all vehicles)*.
